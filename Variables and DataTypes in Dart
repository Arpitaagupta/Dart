Variables and Data Types in Dart

In Dart, variables are used to store and manipulate data during the execution of a program. They can hold different types of values, which are referred to as data types. Dart is a statically typed language, meaning that variables are explicitly declared with their data types.

Here are some important points about variables and data types in Dart:

1. Variable Declaration:
   Variables in Dart are declared using the `var` keyword followed by the variable name. 
   For example:
   ```dart
   var age = 25;
   ```
2. Data Types:
   Dart has several built-in data types, including:
   - Numbers: `int` (integers), `double` (floating-point numbers)
   - Strings: `String` (sequence of characters)
   - Booleans: `bool` (true or false)
   - Lists: `List` (ordered collection of objects)
   - Maps: `Map` (collection of key-value pairs)
   - Sets: `Set` (unordered collection of unique objects)

3. Type Annotations:
   Dart allows you to explicitly specify the data type of a variable using type annotations. Type annotations are added after the variable name using a colon (:). 
   For example:
   ```dart
   int count = 10;
   ```

4. Dynamic Type:
   Dart also supports the dynamic data type, which allows a variable to hold values of any type. The type of a dynamic variable is determined at runtime. 
   For example:
   ```
   dynamic value = 'Hello';
   ```
   
5. Type Inference:
   Dart has type inference, which means the type of a variable can be automatically inferred based on the assigned value. When using the var keyword without specifying the type explicitly, Dart determines the type based on the assigned value. 
   For example:
   ```
   var name = 'John'; // Dart infers the type as String
   ```
   
6. Constants:
   Dart provides the final and const keywords to declare constants. Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned. The final keyword allows a variable to be assigned only once, while the const keyword is used for compile-time constants.

7. Null Safety:
   Starting from Dart 2.12, Dart introduced null safety, which helps prevent null reference errors. Variables can be declared as nullable using the ? operator or as non-nullable using the ! operator.

These are the key concepts related to variables and data types in Dart.
